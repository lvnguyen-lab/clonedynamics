This Github directory includes information relevant to the following publication from the Nguyen and Caldas labs:

Nguyen LV et al. Dynamics and plasticity of human breast cancer single cell-derived clones. [Journal] [Year] [DOI]

The CODE folder contains the scripts used for data analysis. Specifically, DTime_Sim and Plots_Sim contain the code for the mathematical modelling presented in Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 5. [XXX] contains the code for all the scRNAseq data analysis presented in the paper.

The PROCESSED_DATA folder contains the processed data tables required for the analysis. This includes the input dataframe (hist.Rda) required to run DTime_Sim and Plots_Sim, and mcid_LNv2_QC.rda which contains the metacell ID (mcid), cell type, lentiviral-based cellular barcode sequence (var_seq), and doubling time information pertaining to each single cell RNA profile.

RAW DATA and processed counts table from bulk and single cell RNA sequencing were submitted to GEO. The bulk RNA sequencing files are available through GEO accession number GSE263518 and single cell RNA sequencing files are available through GSE [XXX].

FOR REVIEWERS: Encrypted folders can be accessed using a password, which is the first word of the Introduction section of the manuscript.
